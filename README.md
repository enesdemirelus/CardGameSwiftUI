This is one of the first projects I worked on SwiftUI. When you click the Deal button, game randomly selects a card and score the winner. The code is simple, but the main purpose of this project was learning the design aspects of SwiftUI. The project is from the video [CodeWithChris](https://www.youtube.com/@CodeWithChris) uploaded in April 6, 2023 called [How to Make an App in 8 Days (2023) - Full Walkthrough.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0t-RCSlasE&list=PLMRqhzcHGw1Y5Cluhf7pKRNZtKaA3Q4kg&index=10&ab_channel=CodeWithChris) All images in the project belongs to him. Also the game never finishes because I couldn't figured it how to give an error to the user.
